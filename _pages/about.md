I am a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Na Meng](https://people.cs.vt.edu/nm8247/). I have completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineerings from [Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology (AUST)](http://aust.edu/). 

My area of research is Software Engineering, and Software Security. I am currently working on helping developers maintain project configuration well, so that they face fewer run-time errors and security issues. I frequently use self-made external Domain Specific Language, Static Program Analysis, and optimized Algorithm & Data Structures to solve different research problems.

After graduation, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/), Bangladesh for 3.5 years. I am passionate about solving algorithmic problems. During my undergrad studies, I was an active participant in the national and international level programming contests.
